        "description": "The thing that matters to me most is that my music makes me feel something, it's become this way for me to record my life and embed my story into what I create. I like the idea that the people I love and maybe their children will listen back one day and start to pick through the music and find all these memories buried in there. I always start writing with some kind of sample I recorded on my phone, and while digging through my audio notes I found this recording of my daughter's heartbeat.. I recorded it during one of the early scans and had totally forgotten about it.. I knew instantly that this was the starting point for me that day. I feel like the only thing we can rely on to help us stand out these days",

        "description": "Totes Emosh (Scene 2) Is about being overwhelmed with a feeling, when it bleeds into and through the rest of your life consuming you and changing how your feel about everything. The song is just that: a feeling. It's my favourite track to listen too because it just feels so me. It's wonky and imperfect but beautiful because of those things. It makes me feel something different every time and I always get lost in it when I listen",

        "description": "Bubbles is about the sonic connection between experiences and sound. The track started as i often do with a sample of my life, its was a day where my young kids were playing with my mum and it got me thinking about how they may not remember these moments when they grow up and how important it can be to remember not the just moment but the relationships between people in it, what they mean to each other and how they make each other feel. The excitement and pure joy of kids when they are young is a powerful thing. It brings everyone around them back to the simple pure moments they get from the simple things in life. It's how I think people often feel in a rave too, it’s something music does for so many people; it transports us to another place mentally where we can shut out the world and let go in a way that I saw that day in the simple amazement of Raffy chasing bubbles. So, in a way Bubbles is simply about letting ourselves feel like we are 2 years old chasing bubbles x",

        "description": "Meant To Be is about growing as a person and how moments in your life can be so overwhelming at the time you can’t make sense of them but as you grow older you come to terms with how they contributed to making you who you are. They can make you more resilient, more compassionate and better equipped at how to deal with them in the future… and you understand it was meant to be that way. It's a record that for me captures so much of what I love about UK dance music. I've always been obsessed with sampling and hip hop and consequently the music that influenced me the most draws from the same places, whether that's Portishead, Tricky, Jamie XX, Aphex Twin, Four Tet, Moby, Caribou.. it's this soulful imperfection that gives them their own sound as they absorb the music around them and turn it into their own thing. It’s always something I try to keep in mind when I'm making my music. We are in a time where the sound of music is getting more and more homogenized and although my music isn't always perfect that's a decision I make, I feel like it makes more sense to be me, than imitate whatever trend is happening right now.",
