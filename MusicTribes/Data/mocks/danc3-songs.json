It was made a little over a year ago, but only released now.\n\nThis track is very interesting for me because of the experiments that were put into it.  I wanted to make a track with a little vocal sample. But I don't have a microphone and I don't have a good singing voice. To realize this idea I involved my wife with an iPhone and an open messenger telegram. After a few minutes of experimentation, I got the result you'll hear in this track :)\n\nThat was awesome, hope you enjoy listening to it!",

I just tried to bring the song into my own world by adding some new sounds and letting the idea flow freely. Really happy with how it turned out. I hope you enjoy, and thank you for listening.",
