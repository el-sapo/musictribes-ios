Well, this song is about those moments :)\n\nBeing the last track to be finished on my debut EP, it was created after I realized I needed something more energetic and uplifting in the project. That's when I asked Karolina Wilgus for help, and she ended up adding these beautiful vocals!\n\nI've been working on this EP for the past two years, and only recently was I able to finish it (collaborations make projects more difficult to finish, who would have thought :)). But yeah, join me on this journey and support in any way you can. Sharing it with a friend is already enough!!\n\nThis song, along with the rest of the EP that's about to drop, took a lot of effort, so I really hope it connects with someone out there <3",

This song continues to evolve, and by the end, you‚Äôre in a completely different space than where you started.\n\nReally couldn‚Äôt have made this track without edwin. His vocals and writing allowed me to take the music to a space that felt both familiar and adventurous.\n",

The remix is imperfect, its chaotic and its not an arrangement a label would ever approve, so it made me feel excited about making music again. \n\nThis drop represents what I love about this platform, its a place I can release music that I never felt I could before. It will only exist here, and I love that. \n\nI made this at a time where I really needed an emotional release, and after getting a spot in the Optimism We Love Art competition for my project SCENES my head was spinning, but creating music grounds me.. and so does releasing it into the world on my own terms. \n\nIf you like this remix then check out my SCENES project now, and take part by submitting a memory!\n\nMuch love and thanks for your support.\n\nJ xx\n\n\n",

    "description": "Dasha, a 23-year-old artist and songwriter, has rapidly ascended as an upcoming artist to watch, and closely. Her 2021 EP, 'Shiny Things' captivated a devoted TikTok fanbase, paving the way for her eagerly anticipated debut album, 'Dirty Blonde' which was released in early 2023. Dasha's music has achieved millions of streams and secured placements on prominent editorial playlists such as Spotify's New Music Friday Country, Night Pop, Chill Pop, Soda, NMF Belgium, and Apple Music's Acoustic Summer and Breaking Singer/Songwriter. The best part is we're just getting started. \n\nAustin was one of the first country songs I wrote for my album dropping in February. I knew this song was going to be pivotal in my career right when we wrote it. We hired a choreographer to make a 2 step dance to help bring my dream alive and have every honky tonk in America dancing to Austin on a Friday night. The prize money would help me reinvest in social promotion and continue to build my fan community. We believe in this song so much and truly know it can be one of the biggest country songs with the right push. ",

This premium 1800 collection consists of 9 original songs that are personified into Raver characters. \n\nAll characters in the Raver universe were hand drawn by Jadyn Violet and are dynamic. \n\nThis means as the songs (also known as Ravers) go up in streams on Spotify -> The Ravers levels up unlocking various utilities. \n\nBringing music to life like never before!\n\nHalo Dreamer is the first of many \"Lost Ravers.\" Lost Ravers are not part of the original 9 Raver characters from Raver Realm. Halo Dreamer is a track that encapsulates the nostalgia of loving someone so deeply. The act of something as simple as smelling an old lovers perfume becomes a catalyst to rehash all of the old feelings of lust. \"She took out my old perfume and started geeking.\" \n\nJadyn has a belief that fans can relate to music so much more than they are right now. Taking a song and turning it into a character lets someone relate to the story a lot more than simply listening to lyrics and productions. That is what Jadyn did with Raver Realm, and what he hopes to continue pushing with the Lost Raver \"Halo Dreamer.\"",

    "description": "This song was created over the internet - just like our friendship. \n\nWhen me and Reo first started to work together we were in two different cities: I would fly from LA to Vegas to write and he would crash on my couch in LA if we weren‚Äôt out there. That process went on for months at a time.\n\nEventually I coerced him and his wife to move back to LA and ironically we have worked together in person less than we ever did when we were in two different cities.\n\nReo and I are both interesting types of introverts - in a way that similarity has probably been what‚Äôs kept us such close friends and collaborators over the years. While we‚Äôre down to be the life of the party from time to time, we individually spend the vast majority of our lives working out of our bedroom studios.\n\nOur lives have changed so much since releasing music onchain. DRIVE ME MAD. is a look into that reflection. ",

    "description": "Citadel is the R≈åHKI theme song - first debuted on rohki.xyz\n\nIt‚Äôs been the cornerstone to our world and a moment we‚Äôve patiently waited to release until now.\n\nA full, newly scored version of the track is being shared as our submission for Optimism‚Äôs onchain art competition - and as a tribute to the end of Season 1 and an ode to Season 2.\n\nOver the course of the past year and a half we‚Äôve become fluent in what it means to be onchain while becoming fluent in what it means to use AI and emerging technology to tell our story.\n\nWe started Season 1 with our Genesis Keys on Mirror - a collection which has served as the bedrock to our community.\n\nOur first two songs were done completely independently - bringing our community to our site where they were greeted with Citadel before experiencing a curated mint experience.\n\nThis was an extremely warm welcome - and we were honored to learn that our first song of Season 1 - Desperado - had inspired the creation of one of the most prominent collector communities in onchain music. (check out L·∫°c ƒê√† for more on this)\n\nIt was over time that we realized releasing on Sound was about something bigger than just us - it was about being a part of a collective and an intention to share our music with the world in a novel way while making a conscious impact on our relationship with our community.\n\nFast forward to Horizon - our first release on Optimism and one of the first songs on Sound Swap.\n\nWe were shocked to watch 5k editions be minted - clearly showcasing the power of the superchain and the importance of L2s.\n\nThis led to our next L2 singles Demon, L·∫°c ƒê√† and our CERULEAN EP - all of which were minted on Optimism and released exclusively onchain.\n\nIn total - we've been blessed to have minted 9,825 editions on Optimism across 9 songs to 1725 unique collectors.\n\nThis impact has given us the confidence to take our story to the next level - which is exactly what we plan to do with any potential winnings by expanding our team for Season 2.\n\nSo in closing thoughts - we‚Äôd like to thank our community for joining us on this journey.\n\nFor being such an integral part of what makes R≈åHKI so special.\n\nWe have very ambitious plans for Season 2 - so we wanted to give it our all for this competition.\n\nWe hope you enjoy this free mint and look forward to sharing much more with you in the coming months.",

    "description": "‚ÄúRelief (Solo),‚Äù off Heno.‚Äôs upcoming album \"I'm Tired Of Being Hypersurveilled,\" marks a turning point in the poignant narrative of the artist, producer, and innovator‚Äôs larger concept project. Accompanied by the RELIEF pixel game where arcade tickets minted on ZORA unlock power ups, ‚ÄúRelief (Solo)‚Äù soundtracks Heno.‚Äôs character‚Äôs pursuit of an escape. ‚ÄúDealing with a topic like surveillance, there's a lot of nuance, and a lot of ways to go‚Äìdifferent topics or subtopics to speak on. But I knew escape, relief or pursuit of being free was a sentiment that needed to be on an album like this,‚Äù says Heno. \n\nSpeaking to Heno.‚Äôs personal experience as a black man in America‚Äìthe project‚Äôs allegorical storyline was introduced by a three-part short film released last January in which Heno.‚Äôs character attends a PTSD Anonymous meeting that turns out to be a ploy for the S.Y.S.T.E.M. (Securing Your Safety Through Extreme Means) to spy on attendees. Eventually, his character is kidnapped (as depicted in the ‚ÄúNeybors‚Äù and ‚ÄúSIMMER DOWN‚Äù videos) before being thrown into a simulation seen in the interactive RELIEF pixel video game at which point Heno.‚Äôs character realizes he must find relief and escape. ‚ÄúThis is the point where I recognize I need to get out of the simulation one way or another, even if it means I have to burn the establishment down. I needed to get out. And I wanted to capture the frustration and the feeling of being gaslit while dealing with surveillance and people invalidating your experiences.‚Äù\n\nWritten, produced, and performed by Heno., ‚ÄúRelief‚Äù ‚Äìthe ninth track off HIGH FREQUENCY Volume 2‚Äìviscerally captures the feverish and exhausting feeling of being chased. ‚ÄúIt started with the production‚Äìplaying around with different synthesizers, and then I came across certain sounds that sounded like a chase. The beat sounds like I‚Äôm running from something, I'm literally trying to get the fuck out of there, and that urgency of being in pursuit.‚Äù \n\nBoth futuristic and retro, the industrial nature of the track is perfect for the addictive video game, while simultaneously drawing attention to the very real experience that fueled its creation. ‚ÄúYou gotta make this shit make sense for you but for me, freedom from it all (as well as relief) is what I really want.\n\nCollectors of ‚ÄúRelief (Solo) on Sound will receive 1 airdrop for RELIEF arcade tickets on Zora that unlock power ups within Heno.‚Äôs RELIEF pixel game, will be added to the allowlist for the song‚Äôs upcoming lyric video drop on Zora, and be added to the allowlist for Heno.'s forthcoming album \"I'm Tired of Being Hypersurveilled\", dropping in January 2024\n\n-----\n\nThis is the ninth track from HIGH FREQUENCY Volume 2 ‚Äî a compilation album curated by NOISE and the web3 music community. \n\nRead interviews with each artist at noisedao.mirror.xyz.",

    "description": "As a writer and ever-evolving human being, most of my songs come from real experiences. Whether they be my own, or somebody else‚Äôs. Although they‚Äôre all widely open for interpretation, some are a little more transparent in the details. \n\nUnforgettable is one of those songs. \n\nAs most women do, I have a deeply loving but equally as complicated relationship with my mom. I love her more than I‚Äôll ever love anyone, but she also knows how to twist the knife so effortlessly in ways nobody else does. And when a lot of those wounds continue to open back up time and time again, it‚Äôs difficult to not be reminded they‚Äôre there every day. \n\nWhen something is so prevalent and reoccurring, it tends to interrupt the peace I continue to try and culminate in my life. Sometimes my closest friend in moments of pain is my piano.\n\n'Unforgettable' was born in a studio on Sunset Boulevard with a couple of my closest collaborators, Paul Phamous and Bailey Lindley. It was a slow burn to completion and took almost two years of going back in to refine the tiniest details til I was satisfied with it. It‚Äôs a testament to how powerful this song is, for me at least, because it resonates with the same intensity as it did when i first wrote it.\"\n\n- Mastered by Dale Becker\n- Mixed by Clint Gibbs\n- Written by Annika Rose, Paul Phamous, Bailey Lindley\n- Produced by Bailey Lindley \n\n---- \n\nThis is the sixth track from HIGH FREQUENCY Volume 2 ‚Äî a compilation album curated by NOISE and the web3 music community. \n\nRead interviews with each artist at noisedao.mirror.xyz.",

Myself & my co-writers piled into one of the writing rooms at the recording studio in New York City (the week of NFT NYC) and simply talked through feelings and served the song.. So much happy energy was added when we included the gang vocals at the end and you can feel what this group is all about when you listen to that moment‚Ä¶ I feel nothing but joy to be included in ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs Ok‚Äô and if my musical career can keep going this way, making music this way, then it all will be :)‚Äù ‚Äî Kathleen Regan\n\n‚ÄúThis song started as an idea I had written and demo‚Äôd a long time ago featuring a series of questions starting with ‚Äúis this the intro or the outro.‚Äù Before coming to the songcamp studio session - I took a sec to check in with how I was feeling in the moment and that idea came up. I offered the idea to the rest of the squad and we all built it out together.‚Äù ‚Äî Will Juergens\n\n‚ÄúI feel so lucky to be credited on this song with these amazing musicians who I get to call friends.  The energy of meeting long-time internet friends in person for the first time is something I‚Äôll always cherish, and I‚Äôm so glad this track captured that same vibe.‚Äù ‚Äî Russ Matthews\n\n‚ÄúWitnessing the incredible talents of Will, Kathleen, Kinney, Russ, David and the whole Songcamp Brooklyn studio jam squad was an absolute honor. The initial song was so inspiring I felt compelled to be part of the finishing stage... basically a successful scheme to have an excuse to spend more time with these humans.‚Äù ‚Äî Levi Downey\n\n‚ÄúFrom the moment I heard the makings of this song, I knew it was special. As the studio day was winding down and it was taking form, there was just enough time to record one pass of organ on top, to \"glue\" it together developmentally and emotionally. I feel fortunate to have contributed even a small element to such an incredible work.‚Äù ‚Äî David Young\n\n‚ÄòIt‚Äôs Okay‚Äô is the fifth single off of Sessions Vol. 1 ‚Äî Songcamp‚Äôs debut collection of one-off releases.

So. now after reconnecting again as Matt is heading off to start a new journey in his life working for a creative charity in the jungle in Sumatra, we decided we couldn't let another song we love sit on a hard drive. We want to share it with the world and let the people listen to it who have been waiting for us to release it publicly. This song represents the beginning of new chapters for us both and signs of in a meaning full way one of the most enjoyable and cathartic creative out puts I've been part of, and i hope it come bring some value back for Matt to help support his new adventure in life.\n\n",

    "description": "'RISE' by Elcee the Alchemist, Jamee Cornelia, and Three Oscillators\n\nOut now ‚Üí https://songcamp.ffm.to/rise\n\nWritten by Elcee the Alchemist, Jamee Cornelia, and Three Oscillators\nLead Vocals by Elcee the Alchemist and Jamee Cornelia\nProduced & Mixed by Three Oscillators\nMastered by Conor Dalton at Glowcast\nReleased by Songcamp\n\n‚ÄúI was gassed to find out I'd been put in a band with Three Oscillators and Jamee as they're both artists I was eager to work with. While I've collaborated via the internet before it was a new challenge to create a cohesive work with no immediate communication or feedback during the creative process, only messages. It's sick that we all came through on the same wavelength and managed to capture the energy of resilience. Rising from the ashes.‚Äù ‚Äî Elcee the Alchemist\n\n‚ÄúThis song is about rising above adversity and elevating your situation. Elcee and Brij set the tone and I helped drive the point home. Together we went crazy‚Äù ‚Äî Jamee Cornelia\n\n‚ÄúI think Elcee, Jamee and I made a BANGER! I'm still very new to collaborating with vocalists and rappers so this was a refreshing change for me and I learnt a lot during the process.‚Äù ‚Äî Three Oscillators\n\n‚ÄòRISE‚Äô is the fourth single off of Sessions Vol. 1 ‚Äî Songcamp‚Äôs debut collection of one-off releases. Each Session brings together 3 or more musicians from the Songcamp community and gives them one month to create and finish a song together. Sessions Vol. 1 will feature the first five Sessions, highlighting the incredible collaborative talent of 18 musicians at Songcamp.\n\nSESSIONS S23-004 ¬©",

    "description": "Before you ask, the word 'bololo' is a slang term native to my hometown Barranquilla. we use it to describe a big mess, a brawl, something along those lines. but it can also mean a huge party that is just super out of control.\n\nWhen I was working on this track initially with The Fund, Mark Johns, and Kate Morgan, they asked if there were any cool spanish words we could write around. I obviously hopped on google and looked up Coste√±o slang (coste√±o is what people from Barranquilla are called!) and bololo came up - as you can see we went with it!\n\nI wanted the song to sound like what the word means - hence why the track is pretty crazy production-wise! I also decided to write about a crazy night, I just put myself in the shoes of someone who went out and had one of those nights where you end up in 6 different places, meet 3 people, become friends, and never see them again. I have personally never experienced anything like this so it was pretty fun to just dramatize what this whole ordeal would be like.\n\nWe all had the most fun making and recording this song, there are so many little details hidden in it that make it so special, you just have to listen to it over and over again I guess! enjoy \"bololo\"!!!",

    "description": "Going Nowhere (Enjoying the Ride) was my first album.  \n\nI've poured all my passion and my experiences as a young man into every note of those tracks. Recorded over 2 days in the spring of 2014, with some incredible Italian jazz musicians.  \n\nRecording and releasing this album was a milestone moment in my artistic development. A journey that spanned continents, cultures, and emotions.\n\nAt that point in time I had graduated from the \"G. Rossini Conservatory of Music\" and traveled through most of Europe and Australia, meeting hundreds of incredible musicians, busking on the beautiful streets of Sydney, London, Paris, Rome, etc.\nI also played each and every gig I could find, with all kinds of bands, musicians and DJs. Little by little expanding my musical horizons, acquiring knowledge, feeling and taste.  \n  \nMy journey then took me to Berlin, where I refined my jazz chops.\nI played hundreds of shows around the world with my quartet and supporting other amazing musicians.  \n\nThen, in 2020, when live music went away, I took that as an opportunity to search for new avenues to release and monetize my music. I found an answer in blockchain technology.\nWith no limitations imposed by traditional standards, I let my creativity run wild.\n\nI released my first album on Ethereum in March 2021, 'Nifty Sax Genesis', followed in September 2021 by 'Spheres', which was a ground-breaking success.  \n  \nMy success inspired me to co-found Nifty Music, a music NFT incubator helping fellow artists create their own successful projects.\nNifty Music projects collectively generated over $1 million to-date for our independent artists and their communities.\n\nAnd here we are now at the present moment, with yet another important milestone, the first music NFT I release to include music from my back catalog.\n\n---\n  \nPersonnel:  \n  \nTenor Sax ‚Äì Milo Lombardi\nTrumpet ‚Äì Giacomo Uncini\nPiano ‚Äì Mauro Gubbiotti\nGuitar ‚Äì Diego Donati\nDouble Bass ‚Äì Manuele Montanari\nDrums ‚Äì Marco Frattini\n\nComposed and Arranged by Milo Lombardi\n\nRecorded at Lunik Studio\nRecorded and Mixed By Davide 'Red' Battistelli\nMastered By Luca Marzi\nGraphic Design ‚Äì Marco Scalon\n\nOriginally released on June 26, 2014",

    "description": "üö®This song is part of a crowdfunding and every collector get very cool benefits, read the text bellow so you can get to know more about me and my project better üö® MUCH LOVE üíï\nHi there! Although some of you might know me as Yaxx, my real name is Yagna. That's what my mom calls me.\n\nI'm a singer-songwriter from Havana, Cuba. I'm a mother to an amazing 5-year-old boy. My favorite color is purple, and I recently turned 27.\nI wanted to be a doctor for a short time, but I honestly can't remember when I wasn't dreaming about performing my heart out on stage.\nI started working with a band as a singer when I was only 18 years old and bought my first acoustic guitar on my 19th birthday by saving up my earnings. I've been writing songs for as long as I can remember. The first time I played my guitar, I wrote the song that changed my life, \"Mercedes Benz.\" Yes, I tend to personalize things as abstract as a song because honesty is what unlocks the soul in my music. Working with a \"cover\" band has taught me a lot in the past seven years. I gained stage presence. Performing Led Zeppelin songs helped me improve my vocal abilities, but nothing compares to the feeling of standing on stage and singing the stories I've written.\n\nIn 2020 with the quarantine, all I had was my guitar, so I took that forced break from my routine to improve my songwriting. I helped two Cuban artists finish their albums (for legal reasons, I cannot share their names). I discovered some magical stuff about writing in Spanish (which I am now obsessed with).\n\nI released my first song in Spanish on all digital platforms on September 18th, 2021, called \"Deja Vu,\" since then, my life has been an incredible roller coaster.\n\nI joined Twitter in January 2022 to help promote a collection, and little did I know, I was heading to the warmest place I'd been in forever.\nMy journey as a Web 3 artist started on the Tezos Blockchain, where I released three singles that were somehow related but weren't part of a collection. These songs were all acoustic performances recorded on my cellphone. My most successful song of those three was \"Viernes,\" my first to sell out and which later became my first collaboration with my now producer and partner Caueiro. This collaboration became my debut on Catalog, a 1/1s music market on the Ethereum Blockchain, collected by Xcelencia. For that, I am eternally grateful.\n\nI am a \"me and my guitar\" kind of performer when it comes to my music, but with the profit of my latest collection on objkt.com, \"Yaxx's Nine Lives,\" I was able to switch things up and gather other musicians, I admired for a long time. This gave life to \"Numerolog√≠a,\" my own little band, which we debuted during a concert on my 27th birthday. Needless to say, it was a dream come true!\n\nI can proudly say I now have enough material to record and release my first full-length album: NUMEROLOGIA: THE ALBUM, a 9 tracks love story.\nI'm super excited to share this album with the world.\nBeing a full-time singer in Cuba is a constant struggle financially. Life in Cuba can be challenging even for people that are not professional artists.\n\nFor context, selling one edition is listed at\n0.005 eth (~9 USD) equals a two-month concert salary. I won't mention the daily living expenses because this is NOT about that. This is about music and art and love!\n\nSo, I am releasing a crowdfunding NFT. I've written a beautiful, soulful song called \"Lights on Me,\" which encompasses everything I am attracting and manifesting for this new career era. This will be a limited edition, 540 editions (yes, I have a thing for the number nine, and I can tell the number nine has a thing for me as well). \n\nThe Lights on Me NFT will be listed at 0.01 eth (approximately 20 USD at the time of this article) and is available from August 27th\nOur main goal is to collect at least 540 editions before November 25th (90 days) to release the full album on April 27th.\n\nBelow are the details of the benefits of being a holder:\nAll the holders get access to Metaverse concerts and behind-the-scenes content of the album process and receive merch! This care package will include a personalized hand-written note expressing my gratitude and some fabulous album material.\n\nThe maximum amount of mints per wallet will be 5 editions. The more editions that are minted means more benefits to the holders:\n1 minted= access to presale to the album with a 50% discount.\n2 minted= access to presale to the album with a 75% discount.\n3 minted= 1 free copy of the album.\n4 minted= 1 free copy of the album AND  a custom NFT cover song\n5 minted=  free copy of the album AND  a custom NFT cover song and a 25% discount on future mints, no matter the Blockchain.\nFollow me on all social media platforms (@yaxx_castillo), and be sure to turn on notifications, as there will be many spaces and performances over the next 90 days. I'm always glad to connect and get to know my followers and supporters. Thanks for reading. Much love.",

Picture a classic sound blended with fresh vibes, like a timeless melody meeting a modern groove. My goal? To give you music that makes you move and fills you with positive vibes.\n\nBut that's not all ‚Äì I'm joined by two awesome people, Crittie and Martin, who believe in my art and support me every step of the way. They're part of my journey in the world of web3 and music, making our connection even stronger. Both of them were top collector and golden egg winner in my last release, \"Feel Tha,\" which was carefully chosen by the talented folks at Danc3.\n\nSo get ready for more love, more music, and those good vibes we all crave. Let's make this journey together, one beat at a time.\n\nNow you got it! ",

This track After Bura is inspired by all the events during that week :)\n\nIf you want to hear more about the story, head to mine and Karolina's Youtube channels. We did a 2 part doc about it (it's very funny go check it out) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH17KJwqr24) - Part1\n(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fO-hLfTuZcA) - Part2\n\nCheck our socials!!\nInstagram: @wilguskarolina @ouni_huni\n\n(me and Karolina we are both finishing our debut solo EP with some very sick collaborations so keep an eye on us ;))",

He selected the track to create the piece for and cooked up this amazing eye candy to stimulate your brain as you listen. \n\nThis song is about setting yourself up for failure. Why do we engage in self-destructive actions? It‚Äôs almost like there's a part of our brain actively rooting for our failure. \n\nI originally wrote this piece for the LNRZ x kits.io flip using samples from their satellites project. I feel like this track is an interesting combination of my influences featuring grunge/90‚Äôs alt rock vocals, w/ more modern polished electronic dance synths. \n\nThank you for listening! \n\nIf you want to see more of J0YK1D‚Äôs portfolio check it here: https://linktr.ee/j0yk1d \n",

It narrates a journey through challenging experiences, where I searched for answers and ways to alleviate pain, only to discover a profound truth: the power to save myself lies within.\n\nAs time passed, I transformed into someone who finds solace in silent contemplation, preferring introspection over superficial conversations and debates. While it may seem that not everyone comprehends me, I choose to support and listen to others, even as I fight my personal battles in secrecy.\n\nThis musical revelation unveils a life-changing lesson‚Äîthat once you've risen from the depths, you possess an unwavering strength and intrinsic value that transcends material possessions, career success, or achievements. The path of self-discovery is unending, but with each step, I embrace it with renewed passion, for I believe this is what it truly means to embrace the essence of the human experience. \n\nThis is #HeybelaSessions 3/4 Ft Scale & Nexan\n\nA musical movement spearheaded by HeyBela, aimed at forging powerful collaborations with producers who bring their unique sound to challenge her to rap in different rhythms.\n\nScale & Nexan are two talented producers from Medell√≠n, Colombia, whom I invited to participate in my web3 project so that they could discover the incredibleness of onchain music.\n\nVideo Recorded in Medell√≠n - Colombia.\n",

Each Session brings together 3 or more musicians from the Songcamp community and gives them one month to create and finish a song together. Sessions Vol. 1 will feature the first five Sessions, highlighting the incredible collaborative talent of 18 musicians at Songcamp.\n\n‚ÄúBest part about making heavy calm was getting to see the brilliance of both Matt and Mars; how they work and think about poetry and music. Good vibes the whole way over like a heavy calm.‚Äù ‚Äî Kinney\n\n‚ÄúGoing into this project my main goal was simply to make something that Matthew, Kinney and I would all love objectively as listeners. Our tastes are varied but overlap in some special places, \"Heavy Calm\" hits a lot of those notes with moments of deep bass and pitched down vocals to bring a touch of modernism into what is in essence, a folksy secular song with church-like influences.‚Äù ‚Äî Mars Today\n\n‚ÄúWorking with Megan and Mark was magical.

This track was born when I was looking up at the stars one night and had a sudden feeling. I felt for some reason she was out there looking up too. As if we were sharing the night sky that evening. \n\nImagine that, in a world where two lovers are completely apart emotionally and physically, they still share the same stars. In a weird way, that idea is comforting <4\n\nThis is an exclusive free mint for only 50 lucky people.\n\nThe reason I am not selling this song, is because while I am still working everyday on my major music nft project called \"Raver Realm,\" I wanted to give something special out to the community for free. The major project will be coming out very soon and I cannot wait for you guys to experience it.\n\nShout out to @gendotwav and @davesocozy for the additional production to the track :)\n",

    "description": "\"moneymorphosis\" is a story about how money can positively change a person‚Äôs life, and then how that person can change their perspective on money.\n\ni grew up with a single mother in inglewood, california. although we still had help from my father who lived the bronx, financial stability wasn‚Äôt familiar to us. we had love, closeness, and all the true necessities a human being needs. but since money was our biggest obstacle, it became the ultimate goal. i‚Äôm sure anyone who comes from struggle can resonate.\n\nif i was wiser, i would‚Äôve known that money comes and goes, but love is always the ultimate goal. loving what you do, loving who loves you, and loving who you are is what matters most in the end.\n\n____________\n\n\n\"moneymorphosis\" is the first artist curated project in partnership with LNRZ.\n\ncollecting this piece grants you an airdrop of the entire EP after mint closes.",
